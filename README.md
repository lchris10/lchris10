Hi, I'm Laura, a behavioural scientist with a passion for data science. 

I've just completed a 12-week nanodegree in data analysis with Code First Girls, learning:

- Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and numpy
- Relational databases in MySQL and through Python
- Basics of machine learning, including scikitlearn
- Basics of data visualisation using Tableau and PowerBI
- Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm
- Agile and waterfall techniques and usage of tools such as Jira 

Through other studies, I am also proficient in statistical analysis in R and SPSS. 

Currently looking for an entry-level Data Science role where I can challenge myself and further develop my skills! 
In the meantime, I'll be learning through self-study and uploading projects onto here.
